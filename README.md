## 🛠️ How to Use (planned)

> ⚠️ This project is still in development. These steps show how it will work soon.

1. Clone the repository:

source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

5. Run the Flask app:

```
python app.py
```

6. Go to `http://localhost:5000` and send a POST request to `/chat` with a message.
